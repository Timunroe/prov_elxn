on proposed intermodal hub","source_api":"Milton Canadian Champion","desc_api":"As part of its comprehensive coverage of the provincial election, the Champion invited each of the Milton riding candidates to weigh in on a particular issue. This is the final instalment in a three-part Q&A with your local candidates. INTERMODAL: CN Rail is proposing to build an intermodal hub in Milton. While rail is federally regulated, development of an intermodal that would see 1,600 daily truck trips to and from the proposed facility would directly impact the riding and its constituency on matters that extend beyond rail. The Region of Halton and its municipalities have banded together in an effort to ensure oversight on the project. Where do you stand on the issue? Parm Gill \u2022 PC As the only candidate who attended the recent public meeting, I have been vocal about standing with the region and municipality against the CN Intermodal. I have met with local stakeholders, town staff and Mayor Gord Krantz to discuss the project and how best to support the legal action currently before the courts. This proposed development of 400 acres (growing to over 1,000 acres in the future) would have long-lasting, negative ramifications for Milton and those who live closest to it. To have seen no action by the Liberals, until days before an election is disappointing. For many, this is the single biggest issue in Milton, and I am unwavering in my stand against the CN Intermodal. Eleanor Hayward \u2022 Green I appreciate this is a complex issue with many stakeholders; I\u2019ve paid attention since the 1990s, when the word around town was this CN intermodal plan in the rural south of town. I note the region was assured this was not the case in 2008 as reported by councillors, published in the Champion. As such the regional and municipal transportation planning process has accordingly not prepared for this high-intensity impact. Ontario\u2019s current transit services leave many people reliant on automobiles to get around the GTHA and heavy truck traffic through residential areas will not be efficient for either professional or personal motorists. In theory the Green party and I support regional transportation hubs, to facilitate essential freight movement, favouring rail over roads especially when electrified with renewable energy sources as part of a more sustainable delivery system. However, with most vehicles still dependent on fossil fuels, up to 12 kilometres from major highways, the Milton Logistics Hub would exacerbate carbon emissions enhanced further with regional gridlock. This project is not in a favourable location to serve this community. I support local governance and the vital health and safety of our people and businesses. Indira Naidoo-Harris \u2022 Liberal As a long time resident of Milton, I care deeply about this community. It&#8217;s my home, and I have always been committed to making sure that the concerns of Halton residents are heard and addressed. I have been monitoring the developments of CN&#8217;s proposed intermodal hub for some time, especially the response of our community. I have serious concerns about how this project will impact the quality of life of families who live near the proposed hub. Since it is a federal matter, I wrote to the federal minister of transport some time ago, expressing my concerns and have asked him to consider and address the local community&#8217;s perspective. There have been calls for the province to get involved in this issue. I am pleased to say that the province of Ontario has decided to intervene. This initiative could have a serious impact on the lives of local families. Community voices are essential to good development. It is my expectation that these community concerns are listened to and strongly considered by federal regulators. I will, as I always have, fight for the interests of our community. I am committed to making sure the voices of residents are heard on this vital issue. Brendan Smyth \u2022 NDP The NDP understands and respects local government, which is the closest to the people and provides services and infrastructure that people depend on every day. We recognize that one-size-fits-all policies do not work for Ontario municipalities, and we will develop policies that respond to the unique needs and challenges of communities while also empowering larger towns and cities. We need to repair the provincial government\u2019s relationship with municipal governments. Liberal and Conservative government have downloaded their responsibility to local governments, while interfering in municipal affairs. It\u2019s time for a new partnership, built on respect and mutual support, where every decision is in the best interest of Ontarians. I will work with Andrea Horwath and the NDP in working closely with municipalities to forge this new partnership. I will also work with constituents and stakeholders, including local governments, to understand their concerns about any issues of local importance, like the CN intermodal. It is important to me to be a strong voice for the community and to champion the issues that are important to my constituents at Queen\u2019s Park. It will be my honour to represent my neighbours in Milton and deliver change for the better. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 PRIORITIES: Please list your top priorities if elected and tell us why residents in Milton should vote for you. Brendan Smyth \u2022 NDP My two top priorities are the ones I\u2019m hearing about most when I\u2019m out connecting with voters: education and affordability. Too many of our schools in Milton are clearly underfunded, both in terms of infrastructure and student supports, and this is a problem decades in the making. Liberals and Conservatives have neglected this important public service for too long. We need Andrea Horwath and the NDP, who have a plan to reinvest in our public school system, stop the cuts, and support our teachers and students. And we all understand how life keeps getting less affordable. Since Kathleen Wynne sold off Hydro One, my family\u2019s bills have gone through the roof. We need to get Hydro One back where it belongs, in public hands, and restore the legacy of public power that made Ontario an economic powerhouse for generations. In the process we can bring bills down by 30 per cent and keep them down. People in Milton should vote for me because our party\u2019s leader, Andrea Horwath, is the only leader who has presented a fully costed platform that can bring change for the better to our community and to our province. Indira Naidoo-Harris \u2022 Liberal Milton has been my home for 25 years. Four years ago, residents had a long list of things they wanted me to accomplish: a bigger hospital, more schools, a university campus, expanded GO services, and a new courthouse. And I was able to deliver on all of those requests. Our party is also making historic investments in free preschool child care, free post-secondary tuition, OHIP+ for young people and seniors, $190 billion in infrastructure and $2.1 billion in mental health and addictions supports. I will build our community up and put Milton families first. My focus will be to deliver two-way, all-day GO service, continue to build education and to support local health care. I will also work on creating more infrastructure and services closer to home. Making cuts to the system like the PCs are proposing is not the way forward. It will remove vital funding from the system and create chaos in our schools and hospitals. And the NDP&#8217;s promises are not enough. Their platform&#8217;s $1.4 billion dollar hole is troubling. Finally, I will work hard for the people of Milton. I have a strong track record of delivering on commitments. I will not be absent at debates, I will not be absent in the house, and I will not be absent on the job. Eleanor Hayward \u2022 Green When elected, first I plan to ensure a long-term plan for Milton to join more than 1,000 international cities and regions committed to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2050. The Green party has the only platform to meet Ontario\u2019s GHG targets and avert climate crisis. We can save $1.1 billion per year by closing Pickering Nuclear station on schedule and plan to divert those funds into a Green Building and Business Program with grants and interest-free loans for energy retrofits. This would save the average homeowner about $1,000 per year and create seven times more jobs than the same dollar invested in oil and gas \u2014 jobs in clean tech innovation and manufacturing, architecture and design, construction and trades. Derry Green Business Park is set to break ground soon and I intend to facilitate great middle-class work here in town. Second, the Green party and I intend to create a new umbrella organization called Mental Health and Addictions Ontario to consolidate and prioritize programs and services consistently across the province under OHIP+. This is part of our plan to transform the health care system to focus on preventing illness and promoting health in addition to treating sickness. A healthier population is a win-win sustainable solution for everyone. Parm Gill \u2022 PC I am proud to live in Milton with my wife and three children and should I be elected, I will be a strong voice for our community at Queen\u2019s Park. The top priorities that I will take action on include ending Liberal waste and cutting hydro bills. An Ontario PC government has committed to lowering hydro bills by 12 per cent and scraping the Liberal Carbon Tax. I want to put money back in your pocket. Through programs that cut the price at the pumps by 10 cents per litre, or refund child-care expenses up to $6,750 per child, a PC government will make it more affordable to live in Milton. Investing in all-day GO train service. Miltonians have seen empty promises but no action on this issue. I commit to take action and invest in all day GO train service. I will stand with the region and municipality against the CN Intermodal.","link":"https:\/\/www.thespec.com\/news-story\/8638860-q-a-milton-candidates-weigh-in-on-proposed-intermodal-hub\/","img_api":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/c\/c\/cc7a7e1f-37eb-4711-9933-3be014ef663f\/MILTON_HEADSHOTS_Super_Portrait.jpg","img_api_thumb":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/c\/c\/cc7a7e1f-37eb-4711-9933-3be014ef663f\/MILTON_HEADSHOTS_150x100.jpg","pubdate_api":"2018-05-30T08:00:00","timestamp":"05-30 8:00 am","site_api":"Milton Canadian Champion","author_api":"","region_api":"halton","label_api":" | Milton Canadian Champion","draft_api":false},"25":{"desc_user":"","draft_user":0,"rank":0,"rank_time":0,"label_user":"","title_user":"","region_user":"","asset_id":"8639264","title_api":"A look at Ontario election childcare plans","source_api":"The Canadian Press","desc_api":"A look at childcare plans proposed this election by Ontario&#8217;s three main parties","link":"https:\/\/www.thespec.com\/news-story\/8639264-a-look-at-ontario-election-childcare-plans\/","img_api":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/e\/e\/eefd361e-2968-4a9c-8bcb-17b62b83ffe9\/CPT502478711_Super_Portrait.jpg","img_api_thumb":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/e\/e\/eefd361e-2968-4a9c-8bcb-17b62b83ffe9\/CPT502478711_150x100.jpg","pubdate_api":"2018-05-30T04:00:04","timestamp":"05-30 4:00 am","site_api":"","author_api":"","region_api":"","label_api":"The Canadian Press","draft_api":false},"26":{"desc_user":"","draft_user":0,"rank":0,"rank_time":0,"label_user":"","title_user":"","region_user":"","asset_id":"8636644","title_api":"Doug Ford defends lack of full platform","source_api":"The Canadian Press","desc_api":"Another busy day for Ontario&#8217;s main party leaders as election draws closer","link":"https:\/\/www.thespec.com\/news-story\/8636644-doug-ford-defends-lack-of-full-platform\/","img_api":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/7\/2\/72fdf403-0ef6-43aa-b9ff-5855a3fe2314\/NSD104478241_Super_Portrait.jpg","img_api_thumb":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/7\/2\/72fdf403-0ef6-43aa-b9ff-5855a3fe2314\/NSD104478241_150x100.jpg","pubdate_api":"2018-05-29T17:48:11","timestamp":"05-29 5:48 pm","site_api":"","author_api":"","region_api":"","label_api":" | The Canadian Press","draft_api":false},"27":{"desc_user":"","draft_user":0,"rank":0,"rank_time":0,"label_user":"","title_user":"","region_user":"","asset_id":"8638585","title_api":"Horwath has chance meeting with former Liberal premier","source_api":"The Canadian Press","desc_api":"Horwath has chance meeting with former Liberal premier Peterson","link":"https:\/\/www.thespec.com\/news-story\/8638585-horwath-has-chance-meeting-with-former-liberal-premier\/","img_api":"","img_api_thumb":"","pubdate_api":"2018-05-29T17:22:31","timestamp":"05-29 5:22 pm","site_api":"","author_api":"","region_api":"","label_api":" | The Canadian Press","draft_api":false},"28":{"desc_user":"","draft_user":0,"rank":0,"rank_time":0,"label_user":"","title_user":"","region_user":"","asset_id":"8643131","title_api":"Ontario Grits fighting to salvage Hamilton&#8217;s only Liberal riding","source_api":"","desc_api":"&#8220;We are going to have a minority government, I expect,&#8221;

This is the final instalment in a three-part question-and-answer with your local candidates. HOUSING: First-time homebuyers in Oakville and Burlington are often priced out of the market. What measures would your government implement to make homeownership within reach? Frank DeLuca \u2022 Trillum I agree that housing is priced out of the market and not affordable for first-time buyers. Although interest rates are still low, the cost of owning a home for single- or even double-income families leaves little for the remaining expenses. I believe the only way to cure this is to provide governmental assistance for low-income housing. We currently have CMHC insurance for high ratio financing, we need more programs geared to the lower income families, but the real root is saving enough to get into the market. This goes hand in hand with all the other expenditures, carbon tax, hydro rates, and taxes. If we can curb these increases and find redundancies to offset increases, people can save for a down payment. The market is due for a cool down and that\u2019s when people can get in, but not if everything else goes up. Alvin Tedjo \u2022 Liberal I know that for a lot of young families, getting into the housing market here in Halton can be a real challenge. While a strong housing market was reflective of Ontario\u2019s strong economy, affordability became a real and growing concern over the last year. That\u2019s why the Liberal government introduced the Fair Housing Plan to stabilize the market for homebuyers and renters. Through the 16 measures in the plan, we\u2019re making buying and renting a home more affordable and fairer. We also expanded rent controls to protect people against sudden, dramatic rent increases that would force them out of their homes. The plan is working: prices are stabilizing and housing has become more affordable all throughout the GTHA. It also stands as a stark contrast with Doug Ford\u2019s approach on these issues. He was caught on camera making a secret promise to pave the Greenbelt \u2014 only to renege when his secret got out. And he has been clear that he does not support rent control, a system that literally keeps the roof over people\u2019s heads. That\u2019s not right, it\u2019s not fair, and it\u2019s not not a plan to make housing more affordable in our communities. Effie Triantafilopoulos \u2022 PC Our plan will increase the supply of housing by reducing red tape and increasing supply without touching the Greenbelt. When the Liberals brought forward their plan, 1,000 new units that were set to come online were cancelled. On top of that, in 2017, the Liberal government encroached on the Greenbelt on 17 different sites including a site in Oakville North-Burlington. We have also announced our Customer Service Guarantee, which will reduce red tape by implementing a hard one-year deadline for all provincial permits. Only our plan recognizes that to truly address the problem of affordability, we must increase the supply of housing. Marianne Workman \u2022 Green A community where everyone can find a place to call home provides stability for the people and to the economy. Our plan would require new builds to have 20 per cent affordable housing units \u2014rentals, condo, detached housing, apartments; incentivize municipalities to zone for the \u2018missing middle\u2019 \u2014 a combination of mixed-use, medium density housing types and rental units; find ways to implement creative solutions to increase availability and variety of housing styles, including \u2018tiny homes,\u2019 co-housing, etc.; support Halton Second Unit pilot program; increase the speculation tax; and ensure prime farmland and the Greenbelt are protected. Charles Zach \u2022 Libertarian Once again it is big government interference related to the supply of land and the types of housing that can be built on land that has created this current housing crisis for first-time buyers. Affordable housing is an issue that has not been properly addressed by the main political parties. A good start to making housing more affordable is to replace the land transfer tax with a flat rate instead of a percentage, which escalates as the cost of the home increases. The Libertarian party proposes a flat rate of $275. The biggest expense to an average family is taxes. Taxes are much more than the cost of their home. A home can be made more affordable by reducing taxes, letting people keep their earnings to invest in a home. The Libertarian party would cancel the carbon tax, which directly increases the cost of heating your home and makes everything more expensive, including building new houses. The Libertarian party would also cut hydro rates in half, which will give people more money for housing and would reduce the size and scope of government, which translates into lower taxes, leaving more disposal income, greatly helping to make home ownership more affordable. Saima Zaidi \u2022 NDP I know how important it is for families and young people in our community to be able to afford to live here, in this place they have called home their entire lives. But sadly that dream is out of reach for many people. The most important thing when talking about affordable housing is to acknowledge that safe, affordable housing is a human right. Andrea Horwath and the Ontario NDP hold this to be true, and want to bring change for the better on this file for all of Ontario. But after decades of switching between Liberal and Conservative governments, life is getting harder and less affordable for all Ontarians. Our plan includes investing in 65,000 new affordable housing units over 10 years, and also building 30,000 new supportive housing units in that same time period. We will prevent the loss of thousands of existing affordable homes by funding the province\u2019s one-third share of the costs of social housing capital repairs. We will also work with municipalities to encourage development of transit-friendly \u201cmissing middle\u201d housing, and clamp down on land speculation and property flipping to help keep homes affordable. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 PRIORITIES: Please list your top priorities if elected and tell us why residents in the Oakville North-Burlington riding should vote for you. Saima Zaidi \u2022 NDP My top priority will be to be a strong voice and bring the concerns of families living in Oakville North-Burlington to Queen\u2019s Park. I have been connecting with voters on the doorsteps, in my campaign office and at public events and the most common concern I hear from them is affordability. People in this community are feeling the squeeze on the hydro bills, when they go to the dentist, when they go to the pharmacy, and in so many other parts of their lives. Kathleen Wynne sold off Hydro One, and our bills went through the roof. Andrea Horwath and the NDP have a plan to buy back Hydro One, getting private profits off our bills. We will lower rates by 30 per cent and keep them down. No one should have to deal with the pain or lifelong damage of going without dental care or prescription drugs. With Horwath\u2019s Dental Care for Everyone plan, every Ontarian will be able to access the care they need for their families. And we will create Canada\u2019s first universal prescription drug plan for everyone. I will help implement these plans, bringing \u201cChange for the Better\u201d to our community and our province. Charles Zach \u2022 Libetarian The priorities of Ontario Libertarian Party and the theme of our 2018 Libertarian Election Platform is very simple: &#8220;Explore New Possibilities&#8221;. Here&#8217;s how: Hydro Rates \u2014 Cut your hydro bill in half; education \u2013 put parents back in charge; health care \u2013 end health-care rationing; jobs and the economy \u2013 make Ontario a job magnet; property rights \u2013 back off government; youth \u2014 prevent youth from becoming \u2018generation screwed\u2019; democratic reform \u2014 modernize our democracy; government and taxation \u2014 reduce the size ands cope of government. So, who votes for the Libertarian party? People who can no longer, in good conscience, vote for any of the four big government parties \u2014 they are all the same; people who want to vote for the largest party promising a return to much smaller government; and those who might not vote normally since &#8220;it won&#8217;t change anything.\u201d Well, the more people who vote for us, the stronger the message will be that the status quo is unacceptable. Marianne Workman \u2022 Green My priorities include government debt and fiscal responsibility; retiring nuclear plants \u2014 decisions made now greatly affect our future. Nuclear is old technology and expensive. Transition to 100 per cent renewable energy to take advantage of exponentially dropping prices; clean economy jobs \u2014 currently a $6-trillion global industry. We need to get in now so we will be the leaders, selling our products and our expertise. I am dedicated and passionate about bringing positive change to Ontario. It is important to me to connect with people and build community. I would take your concerns to heart. I care about people and the planet and would be a strong voice for Oakville-North Burlington. Effie Triantafilopoulos \u2022 PC The Ontario PC plan is straightforward: we\u2019re going to make life more affordable for Ontario families and seniors and get Ontario\u2019s economy back on track so we can provide the services families depend on without burdening future generations with debt to cover today\u2019s spending. \u2022 20 per cent lower income taxes for middle class families. \u2022 Cutting your hydro bill by 12 per cent by cleaning up the mess at Hydro One. \u2022 Reducing gas prices by 10 cents per litre by eliminating carbon taxes and reducing provincial gas taxes. \u2022 Our community is home to countless young families, our plan will help them find affordable and flexible childcare by providing up to a 75 per cent refund of child care expenses to age 15. \u2022 Add 30,000 new long-term care beds to free up the resources needed to end hallway health care. As a commuter myself, I know that our highways and transit systems need to be treated as an immediate priority, our party is investing $5 billion in additional funding for new transit corridors. Alvin Tedjo \u2022 Liberal I believe that governments exist to help us do the things that we can\u2019t do alone. Alone, we can\u2019t build a hospital or a school. We can\u2019t create a transit system or safeguard the environment. In this community alone, the Liberal government has built the new Oakville Trafalgar Memorial Hospital and ErinOakKids Centre for Treatment and Development. We\u2019ve delivered two-way all-day GO Train service to the Lakeshore West line and protected the Greenbelt from development. Looking ahead, we\u2019re bringing free childcare for kids aged two and a half to kindergarten, and free prescription medications for seniors and children, while investing in mental health and standing up to protect our environment. I\u2019m also running because I think there\u2019s a stark choice in front of us in this election. Will we continue to build the things that our community needs and invest in its people, or will we turn away from that progress by cutting the programs and services that make a real difference in our lives? I\u2019m running to fight for the people of this community \u2014 to fight for better health care, better education and better transit and a cleaner environment to our families. And to keep building the things that we can\u2019t build alone. Frank DeLuca \u2022 Trillium My priorities are aligned with the Trillium Policies. We oppose the carbon tax, we want to regain control of the hydro supply. We believe that sex education curriculum should have parent input before distribution. We want childcare tax incentives for in home care; we want to educate our youth for skilled jobs, as well as making jobs avail to our youth within the arts and most importantly full disclosure of public fund expenditures. I want to remove redundancy and find efficient solutions for our problems, and lastly be the voice for the constituents at Queen\u2019s Park.","link":"https:\/\/www.thespec.com\/news-story\/8637674-q-a-oakville-north-burlington-candidates-discuss-affordable-housing-outline-priorities\/","img_api":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/c\/3\/c3c1bb1a-cda2-43d7-aec9-4efe02b1130c\/OAKNBURL_HEADSHOTS_Super_Portrait.jpg","img_api_thumb":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/c\/3\/c3c1bb1a-cda2-43d7-aec9-4efe02b1130c\/OAKNBURL_HEADSHOTS_150x100.jpg","pubdate_api":"2018-05-29T17:00:00","timestamp":"05-29 5:00 pm","site_api":"Oakville Beaver","author_api":"","region_api":"halton","label_api":" | Oakville Beaver","draft_api":false},"37":{"desc_user":"","draft_user":0,"rank":0,"rank_time":0,"label_user":"","title_user":"","region_user":"","asset_id":"8637806","title_api":"Q&A: Oakville candidates discuss marijunana legislation, share their priorities","source_api":"","desc_api":"OAKVILLE \u2013 As part of its comprehensive coverage of the provincial election, the Beaver invited each of the Oakville riding candidates to weigh in on a particular issue.

This is the final instalment in a three-part question-and-answer with your local candidates. AFFORDABLE HOUSING: First-time homebuyers in Burlington are often priced out of the market. What measures would your government implement to make homeownership within reach? Andrew Drummond \u2022 NDP Too many people can\u2019t afford to live in the neighbourhood they grew up in \u2013 whether to rent or to buy. To make is easier for Ontarians to buy a home, we\u2019re going to clamp down on land speculation and property flipping, maintaining the non-resident speculation tax and introducing new anti-speculation taxes whose proceeds will be dedicated to affordable housing. We\u2019ll also work with municipalities to increase the supply of affordable homes by encouraging them to develop sustainable, transit- and neighbourhood-friendly \u201cmissing middle\u201d housing. And housing affordability isn\u2019t just about being able to buy a home. Regardless of your income, safe and affordable housing is a human right. Our plan will make the necessary investments in affordable housing to build 65,000 new affordable units over 10 years, working with partners, including the federal government and the not-for-profit and co-op housing sectors. We will also spend $1.4 billion to build 12,000 new supportive housing units within our first mandate. Only the Andrea Horwath NDP has a plan to deliver change for the better on this important issue. Vince Fiorito \u2022 Green As Burlington\u2019s MPP, I would work with the Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Halton Region and Burlington City Council to modernize building codes to encourage alternatives to single-family detached homes, such as tiny homes, laneway housing, secondary suites and basement apartments. I would work across party lines to mandate developers build at least one affordable, accessible housing unit for every five new houses, condo units and purpose built rental units. I would impose surtaxes on quick turnaround sales to reduce speculation and call for density bonuses for increased intensification, including funding for medium density housing and rental units that maintain the look and feel of a neighbourhood. I would work to reestablish the brownfield remediation fund to help redevelop unused industrial lands into residential properties. The Green Party would create a provincial coordinated access point for all affordable housing options available to create a streamlined application for waitlist and placement. We would provide funding to renovate deteriorating social housing stock and introduce new social housing units in their communities to address unmet local need. As well, we would increase funding for social non-profit and co-operative housing; increase the number of secondary women&#8217;s shelters in Ontario, particularly in the north; impose a vacant property tax; and replace the Tarion monopoly with a competitive multi-provider warranty protection model. Jim Gilchrist \u2022 Libertarian A key objective for me in this election is to create awareness of the extent of the current government debt \u2014 $325 billion, $12.5 billion wasted annual interest \u2014 and the long-term economic impact that it will have on Ontarians, especially young Burlington families. By politicians avoiding appropriate debt reduction initiatives today, young Burlingtonians will inherit the responsibility of reducing this debt in the future. Faced with potential higher taxation, and an overall increased cost of living, their subsequent lower financial resources will make it even more difficult to buy a home. The Libertarian Party\u2019s platform states that we will reduce the Ontario Land Transfer Tax to a flat fee of $275, instead of the current fee based on property value. But it is our larger scale policies that, along with strategic debt reduction, will have the most impact. Lower personal taxation, lower energy costs, and the job creation and upward career opportunities that result from economic growth policies will provide young people with the financial resources to purchase, and maintain, their home. And, by providing lower regulatory costs for developers, and encouraging municipalities to maintain a supply of serviceable, development-ready lands, we would increase supply and thus lower home prices. Jane McKenna \u2022 PC Housing affordability is a serious and troubling issue in Ontario that was left unchecked by the Liberal government for far too long. In recent months the mortgage \u201cstress test\u201d and foreign buyer tax have cooled the market with lower sales volumes and marginal price reductions. Of course, one of the solutions is to increase housing supply. The PC government will not encroach on the Greenbelt for development purposes but there are other planning tools, like reducing red tape and bureaucratic delay that will encourage new housing starts in concert with the municipalities. The other side of the housing affordability problem is income stagnation. To encourage economic growth we will lower the corporate tax rate, reduce the tax rate for the middle class and eliminate income tax for minimum wage earners. Reducing hydro rates and removing some of the 350,000 regulations imposed on business should make Ontario more competitive. In Ontario I believe we have a collective responsibility to ensure that, with hard work, our young people are able to earn a living wage and to expect to be able to buy a little house. A PC government will help get us back on track. Eleanor McMahon \u2022 Liberal Our government has taken action to stabilize the market for homebuyers and renters across the GTHA with the Fair Housing Plan \u2014 a comprehensive package of measures to increase the supply of affordable homes, while also protecting both buyers and renters. It includes a 15 per cent speculation tax on the price of homes purchased by non-residents and foreign corporations, as well as expanding rent control to all private rental units to protect tenants against sudden rent hikes. We&#8217;ve also invested $5.8 million in Habitat for Humanity to create a Build Centre in Burlington to create more affordable housing in our community and across Ontario, and have given municipalities the ability to require that affordable units are created in new residential developments. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 PRIORITIES: Please list your top priorities if elected and tell us why residents in Burlington should vote for you. Eleanor McMahon \u2022 Liberal My priorities continue to be growing the economy and investing in what matters to families. Together, we&#8217;ve accomplished a lot, securing over $80 million in our community \u2014 and we need to keep that momentum going. Burlington has a stronger health-care system with the new patient tower at Joseph Brant Hospital, and I&#8217;m absolutely committed to supporting the next phase of that redevelopment. I have been working to secure a $27-million investment for in-patient mental health beds and services in our hospital. We plan to increase GO Train service on the Lakeshore line to every 15 minutes with electrified service as early as next year. I want to make sure that we continue to support our seniors by removing the co-pay and annual deductible for prescription medications, providing up to $750 a year for home maintenance so they can stay in their homes longer, and building 30,000 long-term care beds over the next decade. We must also ensure that businesses continue to grow and thrive, which is why we cut the small business tax by 22 per cent, lowered electricity costs by 25 per cent for 500,000 small businesses and farms across Ontario and passed legislation to eliminate red tape. We&#8217;re also investing $124 million over three years to help small businesses and employers hire and retain youth ages 15 to 29. Jane McKenna \u2022 PC First, a PC government will be one that is honest, responsible and accountable to the people who place their trust in us. We will spend your hard earned tax dollars on the services you value most like health care, education and infrastructure. Second, we will reduce hydro rates and lighten the tax burden for middle class families so they have more discretionary spending power and for businesses so they can become more competitive. A government cannot continue to pile taxes on top of taxes without improving the standard of living for everyone. No one should be left behind in a province that has the capacity for innovation, increased productivity, enhanced economic growth and prosperity. We will get Ontario back on track. Third, we will invest $1.9 billion over 10 years in mental health, addictions, and housing supports. It\u2019s time to take mental health as seriously as any other form of health, and with this investment we\u2019re going to make sure that those struggling with addictions or mental illness get the help they need. Invest in long-term care and home care so seniors can be assured they will receive the appropriate care in the right setting. Jim Gilchrist \u2022 Libertarian The people of Burlington should vote for me because they are tired of the typical politicians who follow their typical party platforms. Like me, I believe that many people are frustrated with the lack of strong candidate choice, uncomfortable party leadership and party positions that do not truly represent them. Effective government is possible, but only if we are open to \u201cexploring new possibilities.\u201d I\u2019m not going to falsely promise you \u2018free money\u2019 to get your votes. What I will promise is that I will be a very strong voice, on your behalf, to ensure that you get the good government that you are entitled to. My priorities are to ensure governmental accountability and fiscal responsibility; reduce the provincial debt for future generations; offer more choice and greater access to health care; encourage more political awareness and involvement, especially in young Ontarians; initiate structural change to increase government efficiency and rationalize services; guarantee that Burlington&#8217;s unique concerns are heard at Queen&#8217;s Park; provide an energy policy with reasonable costs for families and businesses; stimulate business growth and job creation; enable greater parental choice and input for quality education; re-establish Ontario as an attractive business environment; and maintain a transparent democratic process. Vince Fiorito \u2022 Green As Burlington\u2019s MPP, I will work to eliminate minimum municipal growth quotas. I will empower municipalities, so they manage intensification, neighbourhood nature and character with official plans and zoning by-laws. I will encourage intensification with density bonuses, including funding for supporting infrastructure, mass transit, dedicated bus and truck lanes, EV infrastructure, pathways for pedestrians, bikes and mobility aid users. I support funding a mass transit solution from the Burlington GO station to Spencer Smith Park, if Burlington&#8217;s OP meets intensification targets. I support trading air development rights above and below Burlington\u2019s provincially owned GO train stations for developer assets stranded in the Greenbelt and C2E Ecopark. I envision mixed-use development, including underground parking, groceries and retail shopping at ground level with above ground office space, affordable accessible housing, condos and luxury condos. I support growing Burlington\u2019s Greenbelt lands with \u201cUrban River Valley\u201d ecosystem designations for Burlington\u2019s waterways. Our wetlands should clean and purify our air and water, not be sources of pollution. I support an MZO to halt the Aldershot Quarry expansion and another MZO to significantly increase quarry operator reserves elsewhere. Please consider all your election choices including the Green Party and vote for the candidate who best represents your values. Andrew Drummond \u2022 NDP To put it simply, the reason I am running is that we can do better. Within Burlington and all of Ontario, there are a lot of families that are struggling. Household budgets are weighed down by excessive hydro rates. Seniors in long-term care are struggling to maintain dignity. Low-income families working multiple jobs still can\u2019t make ends meet. We can do better. If elected, I, as part of Andrea Horwath\u2019s team, will fight to make lives better for Burlington. Our key priorities are to repurchase Hydro One so we can control the company and lower Hydro Rates by 30 per cent; build 40,000 new long-term care beds over 10 years and introduce new standards for four hours of services per day; introduce universal pharmacare and dental care plans so that no family ever has to choose again between taking medications and feeding their families; bring an end to hallway medicine and ensure that a trip to the emergency room doesn\u2019t involve languishing on a stretcher. I have canvassed thousands of homes in this riding over this election and truly appreciate every conversation I\u2019ve had. I believe that I can bring not just change to Burlington, but Change for the Better.","link":"https:\/\/www.thespec.com\/news-story\/8638152-q-a-burlington-weigh-in-on-affordable-housing-outline-priorities\/","img_api":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/8\/7\/87b4e033-a24a-4bf8-a69a-0ef0e602ff40\/BURLINGTON_HEADSHOTS_Super_Portrait.jpg","img_api_thumb":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/8\/7\/87b4e033-a24a-4bf8-a69a-0ef0e602ff40\/BURLINGTON_HEADSHOTS_150x100.jpg","pubdate_api":"2018-05-29T17:00:00","timestamp":"05-29

to Liberal candidates, says Bradley","source_api":"","desc_api":"Relief. That is how Jim Bradley, the elder statesman of the Liberal Party of Ontario, described the unprecedented electoral gambit of his party&#8217;s leader and the province&#8217;s premier. On Saturday, with polls showing her party in the basement with little chance for electoral victory Thursday, Liberal leader and Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne conceded defeat. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know who voters will choose but I am pretty sure that it won&#8217;t be me. After Thursday, I will no longer be Ontario&#8217;s Premier. And I&#8217;m okay with that,&#8221; she said. Wynne urged voters to send as many Liberal MPPs back to Queen&#8217;s Park as possible to prevent her rivals - Progressive Conservative leader Doug Ford and New Democratic Leader Andrea Horwath - from forming a majority government with what she called &#8220;a blank cheque.&#8221; Bradley, the Liberal MPP for St. Catharines for some four decades, said Wynne&#8217;s decision was the best one that could be made under the circumstances. While he expressed no misgivings about Wynne&#8217;s leadership, he said her unpopularity was crippling the campaigns of Liberal candidates across the province. &#8220;I am sure this is a relief to many,&#8221; Bradley said Saturday afternoon while campaigning door-to-door. &#8220;Many of us would hear it at the door. I certainly have heard it. It is not uncommon to hear from a voter who would say &#8220;I would love to vote for you, but I cannot vote for Kathleen Wynne.&#8221; As word of Wynne&#8217;s concession spread, Bradley said some voters have said they could now cast their vote for a Liberal. &#8220;Already this morning, a person at the door said they could vote for me now that Premier Wynne is not going to be premier,&#8221; he said. Polls place the Liberals in a distant third place behind the Tories and NDP, who are fiercely competing for ridings across Ontario. Last week, Ford and Horwath visited Niagara Centre to support their candidates - NDP candidate Jeff Burch and PC hopeful April Jeffs. Wynne&#8217;s new pitch for the Liberals is not about forming the next government, but as a counterbalance for a potential PC or NDP government. \u201cWith a majority government, Doug Ford would have too free a hand for the comfort of most people \u2014 they don\u2019t trust his judgment,\u201d the Liberal leader said. \u201cThey don\u2019t trust the choices he would make. This is a man who was only too happy to open up the Greenbelt to condo development until he was caught out; who mused about selling cannabis in corner stores where our kids shop,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe this is a man that people want to hand Ontario over to without putting him on the shortest of short leashes.\u201d Wynne said a New Democratic majority government also has its risks. \u201cPeople worry about what will happen to our economy if the NDP take power and form a majority government with nothing to hold them back. People worry that the NDP will raise taxes on small businesses, that they will take unemployment higher,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more Liberal MPPs we send to Queen\u2019s Park on June 7, the less likely it becomes that either Doug Ford or the NDP will be able to form a majority government,\u201d said the Grit leader. Although Wynne&#8217;s reframing of the Liberal election strategy may be new to many voters, it was already how some Liberal candidates were approaching the campaign, Bradley said. &#8220;It was a foregone conclusion, particularly when the Liberal party sank to third place in the polls, that we would not be forming the next government and that Wynne would not be the next premier,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So many candidates have already taken this approach, but as I say, her decision today will be a relief to many.&#8221; He said within Liberal circles it has been widely believed for some time that Wynne would step down as Liberal leader after Thursday&#8217;s vote. Bradley said her decision will have little impact on his campaign, which described as a &#8220;personal campaign&#8221; similar to his past efforts. &#8220;I never make the presumption of telling voters that they should vote for me because we are going to be the next government. For me it&#8217;s about the kind of representation you have in Queen&#8217;s Park,&#8221; said Bradley, who touted his time as an opposition MPP and the number of times he has worked with other parties when Ontario has had a minority government. Nevertheless, he said Wynne&#8217;s decision is highly unusual. Even when party leaders are facing what appears to be certain defeat, they usually go down with their ships, choosing to step aside only after the voters have spoken. But in this case, Bradley said, Wynne&#8217;s decision may help the Liberals fortunes in a what is certainly a losing cause. Bradley, running against PC candidate Sandie Bellows and NDP candidate Jennie Stevens, said his party will have to embark on a process of soul searching after the vote. At minimum , he said the Liberals will have to have a leadership race and policy convention to decide the future of the party. Where he may fit in that process should he hold onto his seat is something he could not predict. In the meantime, Bradley said he will continue knocking on doors and talk to voters even though, for the first time in his career, he campaigns for a party that has abandoned any pretence of victory and faces an uncertain future. -with files from the Toronto

It was really out of our control.\u201d Bradley, first elected in 1977, said matter of factly that his campaign was overwhelmed by the provincial results. He said it\u2019s very difficult to overcome polls showing Liberal support at 18 per cent. He praised his volunteers for a magnificent campaign and said some staff were there day and night putting their hearts and souls into it. \u201cIt\u2019s been a genuine privilege to be able serve for 41 years as a Member of Provincial Parliament for St. Catharines,\u201d he said to cheers and applause. Previously considered to have one of the safest seats in Ontario, Bradley held on through other party waves in the past, including Bob Rae\u2019s NDP surge. Ron Cuthbert, the Liberal party riding president who\u2019s run Bradley\u2019s campaigns for almost 30 years, said people generally like Bradley. \u201cHe\u2019s been a good representative. Right at the doors people were very respectful, actually thanking him, and we knew they probably weren\u2019t voting for us.\u201d Cuthbert said in each election they sense the wave the province is going in and then add Bradley\u2019s popularity in the riding \u2014 considered to be worth five to 10 cent of the vote. Again Thursday, Bradley received a higher vote percentage than the Liberal party overall. \u201cThat\u2019s the Jim Bradley factor right there,\u201d Cuthbert said. It wasn\u2019t enough in the end this time. Bradley garnered 24.5 per cent of the vote behind NDP\u2019s Jennie Stevens with 36.6 per cent and PC Sandie Bellow\u2019s 33.6 per cent. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed, but as Jim said and I said earlier, we\u2019re really celebrating 41 years,\u201d Cuthbert said of the crowd gathered. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous service to St. Catharines and the people.\u201d Ron Matsushita, who went to high school with Bradley and has been campaigning for him since his city alderman days, said he felt sad for Bradley in the sense that he lost after serving as well as he has. \u201cJim lost not because of himself and his contribution to the community, but rather because of a tidal wave of change across the province,\u201d Matsushita said. \u201cJim is such an astute individual and astute politician, he understands that, he realizes that.\u201d Matsushita said he expects Bradley won\u2019t disappear from the public. \u201cJim Bradley. Public service. Those are sort of synonymous,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to go fading in the background by any means. He\u2019s going to continue to contribute to our community.\u201d Bradley told his supporters that MPP-elect Stevens knows she can count on his support in the transition. He said he started the campaign with Stevens and Bellows as friends and that hasn\u2019t changed. \u201cThere was no acrimony. We were friends to start and friends at the conclusion. And St. Catharines actually set a very good example for much of the province in that kind of campaign taking place, because it was not that way in a lot of ridings out there.\u201d Bradley said it\u2019s always a disappointment not coming in first, but it\u2019s a good feeling to be part of the democratic process. \u201cSometimes we\u2019ve benefited from strategic voting,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time we didn\u2019t benefit from strategic voting, and so I can\u2019t complain.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.thespec.com\/news-story\/8659214-bradley-says-it-was-a-genuine-privilege-to-serve-for-41-years\/","img_api":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/2\/d\/2d577111-6b7f-4b45-ace7-2a78aa5cc35e\/_MG_7381___Super_Portrait.jpg","img_api_thumb":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/2\/d\/2d577111-6b7f-4b45-ace7-2a78aa5cc35e\/_MG_7381___150x100.jpg","pubdate_api":"2018-06-08T02:04:27.217","timestamp":"06-08 2:04 am","site_api":"St. Catharines Standard","author_api":"Karena Walter","region_api":"niagara","label_api":"Karena Walter | St. Catharines Standard","draft_api":false},"168":{"desc_user":"","draft_user":2,"rank":0,"rank_time":0,"label_user":"","title_user":"","region_user":"","asset_id":"8658686","title_api":"PC David Piccini elected in Northumberland-Peterborough South","source_api":"Examiner Staff Writer","desc_api":"Liberal incumbent Lou Rinaldi loses his seat","link":"https:\/\/www.thespec.com\/news-story\/8658686-pc-david-piccini-elected-in-northumberland-peterborough-south\/","img_api":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/b\/3\/b33d0031-ddb6-44b9-8be1-6d0a6e138e47\/B88222930Z.1_20180608003005_000_GNT798AL.3-0_Super_Portrait.jpg","img_api_thumb":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/b\/3\/b33d0031-ddb6-44b9-8be1-6d0a6e138e47\/B88222930Z.1_20180608003005_000_GNT798AL.3-0_150x100.jpg","pubdate_api":"2018-06-08T00:32:06","timestamp":"06-08 12:32 am","site_api":"Peterborough Examiner","author_api":"Jessica Nyznik","region_api":"","label_api":"Jessica Nyznik | Examiner Staff Writer","draft_api":true},"169":{"desc_user":"","draft_user":0,"rank":0,"rank_time":0,"label_user":"","title_user":"","region_user":"","asset_id":"8658648","title_api":"Greens win first-ever seat in Ontario legislature","source_api":"The Canadian Press","desc_api":"Green leader wins his party&#8217;s first-ever seat in Ontario legislature","link":"https:\/\/www.thespec.com\/news-story\/8658648-greens-win-first-ever-seat-in-ontario-legislature\/","img_api":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/6\/d\/6db29cc5-9b96-42b1-b883-a2621d565a3e\/CPT152480669_Super_Portrait.jpg","img_api_thumb":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/6\/d\/6db29cc5-9b96-42b1-b883-a2621d565a3e\/CPT152480669_150x100.jpg","pubdate_api":"2018-06-08T00:00:51","timestamp":"06-08 12:00 am","site_api":"","author_api":"","region_api":"","label_api":"The Canadian Press","draft_api":false},"170":{"desc_user":"","draft_user":2,"rank":0,"rank_time":0,"label_user":"","title_user":"","region_user":"","asset_id":"8658607","title_api":"Premier prize eludes NDP&#8217;s Horwath in Ontario","source_api":"The Canadian Press","desc_api":"So close but so far: Premier prize eludes NDP&#8217;s Andrea Horwath in Ontario","link":"https:\/\/www.thespec.com\/news-story\/8658607-premier-prize-eludes-ndp-s-horwath-in-ontario\/","img_api":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/5\/9\/59323a27-5814-446b-a065-9e51e7ce8e0f\/FNG901480598_Super_Portrait.jpg","img_api_thumb":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/5\/9\/59323a27-5814-446b-a065-9e51e7ce8e0f\/FNG901480598_150x100.jpg","pubdate_api":"2018-06-07T23:59:29","timestamp":"06-07 11:59 pm","site_api":"","author_api":"","region_api":"","label_api":"The Canadian Press","draft_api":false},"171":{"desc_user":"","draft_user":0,"rank":0,"rank_time":0,"label_user":"","title_user":"","region_user":"","asset_id":"8658854","title_api":"Bittersweet loss for Niagara-Centre PC candidate April Jeffs","source_api":"","desc_api":"For Niagara-Centre PC candidate April Jeffs the results on Thursday night came as a mixed bag.","link":"https:\/\/www.thespec.com\/news-story\/8658854-bittersweet-loss-for-niagara-centre-pc-candidate-april-jeffs\/","img_api":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/c\/e\/ce8b09c3-aed1-4ab5-b610-d87f828fe2f8\/jeffs_Super_Portrait.jpg","img_api_thumb":"http:\/\/media.zuza.com\/c\/e\/ce8b09c3-aed1-4ab5-b610-d87f828fe2f8\/jeffs_150x100.jpg","pubdate_api":"2018-06-07T23:31:27.137","timestamp":"06-07 11:31 pm","site_api":"Niagara This Week - Welland","author_api":"Steve Henschel","region_api":"niagara","label_api":"Steve Henschel | Niagara This Week - Welland","draft_api":false},"172":{"desc_user":"","draft_user":2,"rank":0,"rank_time":0,"label_user":"","title_user":"","region_user":"","asset_id":"8615871","title_api":"ICYMI: Top 5 stories of the week on theifp.ca","source_api":"","desc_api":"If you didn&#8217;t have chance to catch up on all the latest headlines, here&#8217;s a look back at what had people talking across Halton Hills this week.
